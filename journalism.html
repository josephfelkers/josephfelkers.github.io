My junior year I was promoted to co-Editor-in-Chief, and senior year to full EIC. &nbsp;While these higher positions borught new respobsibilities (editing, planning, overseeing lower editors and staff members), I've tried to continue writing at least one story every issue, my initial reason for joining the paper.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong><br></strong></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>Senior interns at Microsoft through Girls Who Code organization, October 2015, writing (feature) |</strong></span>&nbsp;This feature piece was the first story I wrote on staff at the Blue and White, as a sophomore. &nbsp;Learning the conventions of journalistic writing, as well as interview etiquette, was imperative in this assignment, and was a skill I've kept with me my three years on staff.</p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>Swimmers make CC history as state title winners, November 2015, writing (sports) | </strong></span> Being at the bottom of the journalism pecking order, I was assigned the Girls Swim story. &nbsp;It was the one nobody wanted. &nbsp;However, after the girls won a state title, everyone on staff wished they had picked this story. It went on to win a Gold Key at the Scholastic Art &amp; Writing of West &amp; Central Michigan competition.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Hand Foot Mouth Disease infects school community, October 2016, writing (news) | </span>In the face of a schoolwide health crisis, we pushed this story <span style="font-style: normal;">just</span> in time for print. Having to write it in such a quick period of time was difficult, but rewarding and exciting. &nbsp;I remember having to write it over the course of one day, hours before we had to send files to the printer. &nbsp;This piece went on to receive a silver key from the Scholastic Art &amp; Writing awards last year.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Sports teams create electric atmosphere, November 2016, writing (editorial ) | </span>Taking my role as co-EIC junior year, this was one of the first editorials I wrote. After an exhilarating fall sports season, writing this editorial was easy and fun to assemble, mirroring closely the many praising sports stories included in the issue.</p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>Math classes help teacher celebrate wedding, January 2017, writing (feature) | </strong> </span> During the storyboarding for this issue, we were hard pressed for story ideas. &nbsp;This assignment was a stretch, initially, but ended up becoming a story to be proud of. &nbsp;This story was the 3rd place winner for a Human Interest feature for the MIPA individual awards last year.</p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>Relatable priest joins community as chaplain, February 2017, writing (feature) | </strong></span> After hearing mass with our new school chaplain, our staff decided we had to feature him. &nbsp;Being so young and kind, we knew a personality feature on him would be engaging for students. &nbsp;It was unusual, interviewing a priest, but it ended up being a blast to interview and write for the piece.</p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>Greif, inspiration can go hand-in-hand, March 2017, writing (editorial) | </strong></span>This will always be the hardest piece of writing I've ever been assigned as a journalist. &nbsp;Following the loss of a fellow student, our staff wanted to honor Jared Pilczuk in the next issue. &nbsp;On a different page, we ran a brief obituary, and followed up further in our editorial for the month.</p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>Enjoy popsicle-filled kind of summer, May 2017, writing (editorial)</strong></span> | Being the first issue as sole-EIC after my partner's graduation, I wanted to write a more fun, memorable editorial that students would remember heading into summer break. &nbsp;We wanted to recognize the hard work students put in during the past year, and encourage them to relax over break. &nbsp;I think (hope) it was successful.</p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>Parked cars hide on-coming traffic..., October 2017, writing (opinion) |</strong></span> Following a jarring car accident, I felt obligated to write an opinion piece on the parking and driving situation at school. I believe this is one of the only opinion pieces I've written with a tangible result, seeing drastically less recklessness in the parking lot after school, following the publication of this piece.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>We didn't start the fire..., October 2017, writing (editorial) |</strong></span> After the addition of a yearned after cartoonist to our staff, I wanted to write an editorial that would put his cartooning skills to use. &nbsp;It was one of my first humorous pieces, and the cartoon ties it all together. Poking fun at the weather isn't hard to do (but complaining about a lack of air conditioning raised some eyebrows by administration).</p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>Teens work evenings, weekends..., November 2017, writing (feature) |</strong></span> After hearing about a fellow student who works an impressively demanding job, I wanted to feature her, and other students who manage to work during the school year. &nbsp;It's important to recognize not only the students participating in school-related activities, but those who have to take on much more mature roles to support their families. &nbsp;This piece went on to receive an Honorable Mention by the Scholastic Art &amp; Writing awards this year.</p><p><br></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>Other writing awards for pieces not included in this portfolio:&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p>3rd place, News Writing (Editorial) MIPA individual awards, 2017</p><p>2 Honorable Mentions, Scholastic Art &amp; Writing of West &amp; Central Michigan, 2017</p><p>1 additional Silver Key, Scholastic Art &amp; Writing of West and Central Michigan, 2017</p><p>1 additional Honorable Mention, Scholastic Art &amp; Writing of West &amp; Central Michigan, 2018</p><p>Excellence in Journalism Award, Catholic Central Honors Convocation, 2016, 2017</p><p><br></p><p><br></p></blockquote></div>

            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><blockquote><p><span style="font-style: normal;">A responsiblity for all staff members at the Blue and White is assisting with layout and design, every issue. &nbsp;Very quickly into my time on staff, my editor and advisor found that I had a knack for InDesign and Photoshop, assigning me more and more difficult spreads with each issue. &nbsp;Eventually, I took on the task of center spread design, an assignment often daunting to new staff members. &nbsp;I was able to bring new finesse and style to the paper's layout, and continue to teach younger staff members layout skills for when I graduate.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>Center spread, February 2016, design |</strong> </span>This was one of my first center spread assignments, where we wanted to cover the funky hair designs that the hockey (and other sports teams) committed to. &nbsp;On this assignment, I had to learn a lot of InDesign tricks by trial and error, and found myself perfecting Photoshop cut-out skills, making six headshots for different upperclassmen.</p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>Center spread, October 2016, design |</strong></span> Coming off of summer break, our staff wanted to make a center spread dedicated to trends that emerged while everyone was off of school. &nbsp;This spread involved lots of experimenting on Photoshop, trying to make the gorilla, Snapchat, and Pokemon graphs with their iconic shapes. &nbsp;It was a blast to assemble, and received an honorable mention from MIPA for design (feature).</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Center spread, November 2016, design | </span>This issue was dominated by congratulatory stories of fall sports teams winning various titles in their seasons. &nbsp;Our staff wanted to cover as many sports as possible, and with the sports section already full, we decided on an innovative center spread that recognized everyone. &nbsp;After many, many drafts of this layout, I finally came to one aesthetically pleasing enough for my detail-oriented eye. This spread received an honorable mention from MIPa for design (sports).</p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>Center spread, January 2017, design | </strong></span>While yet another center spread recognizing athletics, that winter sports season brought a uniquely progressive season for the hockey team. &nbsp;With our main focus being the first girl to ever join the all-boys team, we chose to cover also two new traditions being brought to the team in a pleasing and digestible fashion.</p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>Center spread, February 2017, design |</strong></span> One of the most fun (and difficult) spreads to lay out, this center spread introduces the student body to the unprecedented number of semester transfers we received at Catholic Central. I did have an issue with one student not wanting her photo included, but I was able to placate her by having a staff member's thumb cover the majority of the photo (top left).</p><p><strong>Center spread, March 2017, design | </strong> </span> An exhausting spread to create, I spent most my time this month begging teachers to make and send me their Bitmojis. &nbsp;Eventually, with deadline approaching, I was able to convince most to let me make one for them (with their approval, of course) to include in the spread. &nbsp;It was a smash hit, with students playing the little identification game for days to follow distribution.</p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>Center spread, November 2017, design |</strong></span>&nbsp;As aforementioned, this spread covers students working during the school year. &nbsp;With my busy fall schedule, it was difficult to obtain photos of students actually at their jobs, but with the addition of a staff photographer, we were able to assign her to run around Grand Rapids, snapping shots of the students on the job. &nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Cover, January 2018, design | </span>Knowing that I'd be graduating in a couple of short months, I wanted to let an underclassman design the center spread for this issue. &nbsp;While I had minimal experience with cover design, something often left to a peer of mine, I tried my hand at it. &nbsp;I wanted to take a more "magazine style" cover, with a picture background. &nbsp;I think it turned out really clean and fresh, compared to the text-heavy covers we've had in the past.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div>
